# Day 1: HTML and CSS

## Questions


### On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?

The purpose of HTML code is to describe the structure of a web page.


### What is the difference between an element and a tag?

While they are sometimes used interchangeably, an HTML element is the collection of start tag, its attributes, an end tag, and everything in between, and an HTML tag is either the opening or closing bracketed characters used to mark the beginning or end of the element.


### Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?

We use attributes to tell us more about the contents of specific elements.


### Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.

The title is an element that tells us a bit about the page on a metadata level,
appearing either at the top of the browser (above the URL) or on the browser tab.  

The head is an HTML block that *contains* the title element.

The body is the container for everything we see on the web page itself.


### In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?

Right click and select "View page source".

### List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, <p></p> is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.

`<strong>To identify content of strong importance</strong>`

`<em>To identify emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence</>`

`<blockquote>To indicate longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph</blockquote>`

`<q>To indicate shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph</q>`

`<abbr>To indicate and describe an abbreviation or acronym</abbr>`


### What are empty elements?

Empty elements don't have any words between an opening and closing tag, and are often represented by just a single tag with unique syntax.

e.g. `<hr / >`


### What is semantic markup?

Semantic markup provides additional information within a web page without affecting its structure, e.g. where to place emphasis in a sentence, where to begin and end a quotation, the meaning of an acronym or abbreviation, etc.

### What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

`<article>``
* intended for a section of content that forms an independent part of a document or site; for example, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

`<aside>`
* intended for content that is not part of the flow of the text in which it appears, but is still related in some way.

`<details>`
* specifies additional details that the user can open and close on demand; often used to create an interactive widget that the user can open and close.
